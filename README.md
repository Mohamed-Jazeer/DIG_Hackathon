# DIG_Hackathon

# GOAL

The aim of the Hackathon is to allow participants to flex their Python skills as well as creativity. In this Hackathon, the objective will be to programme code and draw meaningful conclusion using real time data of Diabetes affceted women.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Diabetes can lead to many complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and amputations. It is important to control blood sugar levels and blood pressure, and to maintain a healthy weight to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. Pregnancies can be a trigger for diabetes. Outcome can be affected by diabetes. People with diabetes are at increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. The data set has information about many parameters which are important for the study about diabetes. This data set includes data of women. The parameters of study are: Pregnancies,	Glucose,	BloodPressure,	SkinThickness,	Insulin,	BMI,	DiabetesPedigreeFunction,	Age,	Outcome.

Study the data completly and analyses the data given for drawing meaningful results and conculsions.

# DATA EXPLANATION

There are two main types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes is the more common form of diabetes, and usually occurs in adults over the age of 40. This form of diabetes occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin, or when the body does not use insulin properly.

Type 2 diabetes is the more common form of diabetes, and usually occurs in adults over the age of 40. This form of diabetes occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin, or when the body does not use insulin properly.

Glucose is the main sugar found in the blood and the body's main source of energy. 
Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of the arteries. 
Skin thickness can be a sign of diabetes. 
Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. 
BMI, or body mass index, is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. 
The diabetes pedigree function is a measure of how likely a person is to develop diabetes. 
Age is a risk factor for diabetes.
